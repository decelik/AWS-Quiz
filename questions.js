      { text: "Modify the S3 bucket policy so that any service can upload to it at any time.", correct: false },
    ],
    explanation: "Getting your EC2 instance to assume a role for accessing an S3 bucket. This method leverages IAM roles, providing temporary permissions which are a safer bet than having any fixed access keys lying around. It keeps your setup tidy by adhering to the principle of least privilegeâ€”each part of your system only has the permissions necessary to function, nothing more. Plus, it nixes the risk of exposing sensitive long-term credentials. Remember, security isn't just a feature; it's a backbone for trust and integrity in your systems!",

    explanation: "Spot Instances for stateless, fault-tolerant workloads that can handle interruptions and have short durations, using Spot Instances is a cost-effective option. Spot Instances allow you to bid for unused EC2 capacity at a potentially lower price than On-Demand Instances. However, Spot Instances can be terminated if the capacity is needed by On-Demand or Reserved Instances customers. Given the nature of the company's workload, where thousands of simulations are run simultaneously and each simulation is stateless, fault-tolerant, and runs for up to 3 hours, Spot Instances would be a suitable choice. This can help optimize costs by taking advantage of the lower pricing for unused capacity."
